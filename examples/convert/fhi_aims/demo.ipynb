    "# FHI-aims Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The FHI-aims Interface module facilitates the conversion of **[FHI-aims](https://www.fhi-aims.org/)** (Fritz-Haber-Institute *ab initio* materials simulations) single-atom calculation outputs into the DeepH DFT data format. FHI-aims is widely recognized as one of the most accurate, all-electron, full-potential electronic structure codes, employing numerically tabulated, localized atom-centered orbitals as its basis set. This rigorous approach delivers exceptional precision for ground-state energies, electronic properties, and forces, making it a gold standard for high-accuracy materials simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the raw data output from FHI-aims can be roughly an order of magnitude larger than equivalent calculations from codes like OpenMX, this inherent complexity presents a uniquely valuable opportunity for DeepH method. The high-dimensional, information-rich nature of FHI-aims data is *ideally suited* for DeepH's machine learning framework. Training on such precise and detailed inputs allows DeepH models to capture subtle electronic interactions with greater fidelity, ultimately leading to superior predictive accuracy for large-scale systems. Consequently, the computational \"overhead\" of the initial FHI-aims data generation is offset by dramatically greater gains during the inference phase, where DeepH enables rapid and accurate electronic structure predictions at scales far beyond direct *ab initio* feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This converter is the product of a sustained, collaborative partnership between the DeepH team and the FHI-aims development group, ensuring robustness and long-term compatibility. While a comprehensive, [ASI-based](https://github.com/PavelStishenko/asi) interface for full periodic systems is under active development, the current module provides native support for converting the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices from FHI-aims **single-atom cluster calculations**. This foundational interface allows researchers to immediately leverage their existing, high-accuracy FHI-aims datasets to train DeepH models, paving the way for next-generation machine-learning-accelerated materials discovery with unprecedented precision.\n",

    "Assuming you have already read the FHI-aims [documentation](https://fhi-aims-club.gitlab.io/tutorials/tutorials-overview/) and are familiar with conducting DFT calculations using FHI-aims, you must organize your FHI-aims data for different material structures according to the following convention.\n",
